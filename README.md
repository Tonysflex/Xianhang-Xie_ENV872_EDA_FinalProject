## Database Information

The dataset provided combines the 2010-2014 "Facility-Level" emissions data with geographical and industry-related data. It is based on the EPA's Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) and Greenhouse Gas Reporting Inventory (GHG), the national system of nomenclature that is used to describe industry-related emissions. 

Chemicals covered by the `TRI` Program are those that cause:

* Cancer or other chronic human health effects
* Significant adverse acute human health effects
* Significant adverse environmental effects

The dataset was made available by the Center for Public Integrity. It can be downloaded from Kaggle: us-facilitylevel-air-pollution-20102014.
